80	Patients were randomized on day 4 either to continue standard therapy alone (group 1, 35 patients) or to receive oral captopril therapy (12.5 mg t.i.d.	The results indicate that: (1) the response of pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio after increasing afterload may be a useful non-invasive method for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction in myocardial infarction patients; and (2) captopril adjuvant therapy as compared to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates alone, after phenylephrine administration, improves the left ventricular performance response in asymptomatic Q-wave post-infarction patients and beneficially affects heart rate.	We have, therefore, studied the effects of captopril as adjuvant therapy to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates (standard therapy) on left ventricular performance in 77 consecutive patients with uncomplicated Q-wave acute myocardial infarction, by the measurement of the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio before and after (0.25-0.50 mg) phenylephrine administration on the 4th and 30th post-infarction days.	8781825	-1

426	METHODS: Seven microalbuminuric, normotensive males with Type 2 diabetes were entered into a randomised, double-blind, three-armed study of (i) intravenous infusion of ANP (0.25 microg/kg/min in 0.9% NaCl) after 3 weeks' pre-treatment with placebo, (ii) intravenous infusion of vehicle (0.9% NaCl only) after 3 weeks' pre-treatment with placebo, or (3) intravenous infusion of ANP (0.25 microg/kg/min in 0.9% NaCl) after 3 weeks' pre-treatment with perindopril, 4 mg daily.	Pre-treatment with perindopril did not alter the changes in UFR (P=0.63), UcGMP (P=0.46) or UAER (P=0.99) to infusion of ANP, compared with the placebo/ANP arm.	CONCLUSION: ANP increases UAER in microalbuminuric patients with Type 2 diabetes and the albuminuric action of ANP is not inhibited by pre-treatment with the ACE inhibitor perindopril.	12925049	-1
427	Patients stabilized on fosinopril 20 mg/day were randomized to receive either HCTZ 12.5 mg od or indapamide 2.5 mg od for 8 weeks, then crossed over to the alternate therapy for a further 8-week period.

449	Twenty-four hour ABPM was performed on two consecutive days (48 h) after a 4 week single blind placebo run-in period and repeated after an 8 week double-blind period during which 20 patients were randomized to treatment with trandolapril (2-4 mg once-daily) and 21 patients to matching placebo.	When compared to placebo by 2 h time blocks, throughout the 2 days of monitoring, trandolapril produced clinically significant decreases in systolic and diastolic BP for 30 and 28 h following dosing.	Since some once-daily agents are more effective than others in maintaining antihypertensive effects toward the end of the 24-h dosing interval this study was designed to evaluate the duration of antihypertensive action of trandolapril using 48 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 41 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.	8867568	-1

471	A total of 54 type 1 diabetic patients with albuminuria and blood pressure (BP) <150/90 mmHg were randomized to receive 10 mg enalapril once daily, 10 mg nifedipine retard twice daily, or placebo in a multicenter double-blind study of 3 years' duration.	However, we found that patients with increased AER have established glomerulopathy and a progressive average decline in GFR of 4.1 ml x min(-1) x year(-1) in the absence of overt hypertension, and baseline AER appeared predictive of subsequent mesangial volume fraction (r = 0.20, P = 0.0018).	In this small cohort of nonhypertensive patients studied for 3 years, disease evolution appears unaffected by treatment with either enalapril or nifedipine.	11289051	-1

505	The aim of the present study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of the very-low-dose combination indapamide (0.625 mg) and perindopril (2 mg) (Per/Ind) with the beta-blocking agent atenolol (50 mg) to determine whether Per/Ind decreases SBP and pulse pressure (PP) more than does atenolol and, if so, whether this decrease is predominantly due to reduction of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (automatic measurements) and reduction of wave reflections (pulse wave analysis, applanation tonometry).	Whereas the 2 antihypertensive agents decreased PWV to a similar degree, only Per/Ind significantly attenuated carotid wave reflections, resulting in a selective decrease in SBP and PP.

610	METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study, in which 18 790 intensively treated hypertensive patients were randomized to either ASA 75 mg daily or placebo for 3.8 years (with a 15% reduction in cardiovascular events and a 36% reduction in myocardial infarction in ASA-treated patients), were reanalysed for the whole group of patients and for various subgroups with particular attention to the possible effects of ASA on BP and renal function.	In ASA-treated and placebo-treated patients: (1) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values achieved with antihypertensive treatment were superimposable, with clinically irrelevant differences; (2) these superimposable SBP and DBP were achieved with antihypertensive therapies, that were quantitatively and qualitatively similar, and (3) changes in serum creatinine and in estimated creatinine clearance and the number of patients developing renal dysfunction were also similar.	Our conclusions cannot be extended to larger doses of ASA, or to patients with congestive heart failure.	12011664	-1

1386	BACKGROUND: It remains uncertain whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors benefit all heart failure patients or just those with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the response to an ACE inhibitor, assessed by urine sodium excretion, was different in patients with low renin versus those with high renin.	DESIGN: Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured in 38 patients with stable chronic heart failure (21 male, 17 female; mean (SD) age 71 (6) years, range 59-82 years) on chronic diuretic treatment alone.	10677399	-1
1387	Quality-of-Life measurements for patients taking which drugs?	Health-related quality-of-life (QOL) measurements are typically applied in chronic or subchronic disorders where the balance between effectiveness (disease-modifying drug effects) and safety (adverse drug reactions) are assessed by patients in terms of subjective well-being.	In general, patients with cancer or hypertension give more reliable assessments of their cognitive and affective symptoms than their doctors do, while patients with primary depression are less reliable than their doctors or relatives in measuring changes in the affective components of their illness when they are ill. Health-related QOL measurements have not only an impact on the doctor-patient relationship but also involve a holistic approach to drug treatment, by checking all the PCASEE components.	10155301	-1
1388	The prognostic implications of renal insufficiency in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction..	Likewise, in the Treatment Trial, multivariate analyses demonstrated moderate renal insufficiency to be associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality (RR 1.41; p = 0.001), also largely explained by an increased risk for pump-failure death (RR 1.49; p = 0.007) and the combined end point death or hospitalization for heart failure (RR 1.45; p = 0.001).	CONCLUSIONS: Even moderate degrees of renal insufficiency are independently associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure, largely explained by an increased risk of heart failure progression.	10716471	-1

1394	The aim of this study was to determine if the qualitative 99Tcm-DTPA captopril radionuclide test (CRT) can help predict the acute detrimental effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on renal function in hypertensive patients with solitary kidneys and chronic renal failure.	In conclusion, our results suggest a role for qualitative 99Tcm-DTPA CRT in the prediction of renal function in patients with a solitary kidney and chronic renal failure subsequently treated with ACE inhibitors.	Between 1991 and 1996, eight consecutive patients (6 males, 2 females) aged 27-73 years (mean 49.8 years) with known chronic renal failure and a solitary kidney referred for ACE treatment were included.	10093076	-1
1395	ACE inhibitors are variably dialysed, with compounds such as catopril, enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril undergoing substantial cross-dialyser clearance during a standard dialysis session.	Although ACE inhibitors have not been compared directly to angiotensin antagonists in patients with ESRD, angiotensin antagonists possess a number of pharmacokinetic and adverse effect characteristics, which would favour their use in this population.	The effective treatment of hypertension is an extremely important consideration in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).	10830252	-1

1832	Beyond the usual strategies for blood pressure reduction: therapeutic considerations and combination therapies..	Rapidly accumulating clinical data have repeatedly demonstrated not only the critical importance of even small increases in blood pressure as a pathophysiologic factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, particularly in individuals with diabetes mellitus, but also the therapeutic necessity of more aggressive blood pressure reduction and the achievement of progressively lower blood pressure targets in reducing cardiovascular event rates.	Target blood pressures are now <or=130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes and <125/75 mm Hg for patients with hypertensive renal disease with proteinuria of >1 gm/24 hours.	11723356	-1
1833	A total of 380 hypertensive diabetics were randomly assigned to open-label fosinopril (20 mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) and followed for up to 3.5 years.

1892	In this randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial, the effect of simvastatin on coronary atherosclerosis was compared with that of placebo in 394 patients who had paired coronary angiograms taken an average of four years apart.	This study examined the effects of long term cholesterol lowering therapy with simvastatin on progression and regression of coronary atherosclerosis, as determined by quantitative angiographic end points, in subgroups of patients with known coronary risk factors.	The effects of treatment on the following prespecified subgroups were examined: sex, age (less than 65 years versus at least 65 years), smoking status (current or previous/never), history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, and severity of coronary artery lesions (diameter at least 50% versus less than 50%).	12717482	-1
1893	After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 51 patients (mean age, 54.4 +/- 9.4 years) with essential hypertension and clinic diastolic blood pressure between 105 and 115 mm Hg were randomized to 4-week treatment with lisinopril (20 mg), nifedipine GITS (30 mg), or their combination according to a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study.	Thus, antihypertensive treatment with the combination of lisinopril and nifedipine GITS is more effective and balanced over the 24 hours than the combination components administered alone, confirming that the smoothness index is superior to the trough-to-peak ratio in assessing homogeneity of pharmacologic blood pressure reduction.

1931	Because this issue remains controversial, we studied the incidence of such complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study.	Using a multiple logistic-regression model with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 33.8).	CONCLUSIONS: In this population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril.	9486993	1

1979	In the former, approximately 85% of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension have responded successfully to treatment with ramipril 2.5 or 5 mg/day, while comparative trials indicate that the antihypertensive efficacy of the drug is equivalent to that of other established ACE inhibitors and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol.	Thus, clinical data confirm ramipril as a useful alternative ACE inhibitor for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, and indicate a beneficial effect of the drug in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

1982	Risks and benefits of early treatment of acute myocardial infarction with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in patients with a history of arterial hypertension: analysis of the GISSI-3 database.. BACKGROUND: Many trials have proved the benefits of early systematic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).	In fact, these patients showed a higher mortality rate as the result of an excess of cardiogenic shock during the first day of lisinopril treatment (odds ratio 3.07, 95% CI 1.39-6.77) and a persistent, unfavorable death trend after 6 weeks.

1983	Those results formed the basis of this double-blind, parallel-group study undertaken to elucidate the metabolic effects of 6 months of doxazosin and enalapril treatment in patients with both essential hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia.	It is speculated that without measurably increasing blood flow in conduit vessels such as the femoral artery, doxazosin, by capillary recruitment, may prolong the transit time for the blood over the muscle bed, which could explain the increased glucose disposal and increased lipoprotein lipase activity.	In a previous open study on the metabolic effects of doxazosin in patients with essential hypertension, subgroup analysis indicated that subjects with an accumulation of risk factors for coronary heart disease (high VLDL triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high fasting blood glucose) seemed to benefit most from the metabolic actions of doxazosin treatment.	8722435	-1
1984	Sixteen hypertensive patients with echocardiographically documented LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction received fosinopril (10-20 mg daily).

2100	Effect of antithrombotic therapy on risk of sudden coronary death in patients with congestive heart failure.. Data from epidemiologic, autopsy, Holter monitoring, and electrophysiologic studies support the hypothesis that acute myocardial ischemia, even in the absence of myocardial infarction, is a critical component of the pathophysiology of sudden coronary death.	In multivariate analysis, antiplatelet and anticoagulant monotherapy each remained independently associated with a reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death: antiplatelet therapy with a 24% reduction (relative risk [RR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.95) and antiplatelet monotherapy with a 32% reduction (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.96).	Thus, in patients with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction resulting from coronary artery disease, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy are each associated with a reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death.	9104905	-1

2177	Health outcomes associated with calcium antagonists compared with other first-line antihypertensive therapies: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.. BACKGROUND: Several observational studies and individual randomised trials in hypertension have suggested that, compared with other drugs, calcium antagonists may be associated with a higher risk of coronary events, despite similar blood-pressure control.	The treatment differences were within the play of chance for the outcomes of stroke (0.90 [0.80-1.02], p=0.10) and all-cause mortality (1.03 [0.94-1.13], p=0.54).	METHODS: We undertook a meta-analysis of trials in hypertension that assessed cardiovascular events and included at least 100 patients, who were randomly assigned intermediate-acting or long-acting calcium antagonists or other antihypertensive drugs and who were followed up for at least 2 years.	11130522	-1

2265	PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 174 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, enrolled in the Study on Ambulatory Monitoring of Pressure and Lisinopril Evaluation (SAMPLE), aged 20-65 years, we measured clinic blood pressure, 24 h ambulatory blood pressure and the left ventricular mass index (echocardiography) before and after treatment with lisinopril at 20 mg with the addition of 12.5 or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide as needed to reach a sufficient blood pressure reduction.	A treatment-induced reduction in the left ventricular mass index was related to the smoothness index for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.35 and -0.32, P< 0.001 with 12 months of treatment), but not to the corresponding trough : peak ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The smoothness index identifies the occurrence of a balanced 24 h blood pressure reduction with treatment and correlates with the favourable effects of treatment on left ventricular hypertrophy better than the commonly used trough : peak ratio.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the comparative efficacy and tolerability of the ARB irbesartan and the ACE inhibitor enalapril in patients > or = 65 years of age with mild to moderate hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP], 95 to 110 mm Hg).	A multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of irbesartan in patients aged > or = 65 years with mild to moderate hypertension.. BACKGROUND: Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is the preferred mechanism of action for controlling hypertension in select groups of patients, including those with diabetic nephropathy and heart failure. METHODS: Elderly (> or = 65 years of age) patients were recruited from 26 Canadian study centers for a randomized, double-blind, 8-week clinical trial.	11110232	-1

2531	In short-term studies (4 to 6 months) we have reported that antihypertensive treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade and thiazide diuretics induced insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and a deranged lipid profile; the ACE inhibitor captopril increased insulin sensitivity without affecting serum lipids.	In conclusion, the magnitude of the metabolic effects induced by antihypertensive treatment during short-term studies was of the same order after long-term treatment over 2 to 3 years and were not significantly different from the results in the short-term studies.	In the present study, 65 of the original 149 patients with essential hypertension included in the short-term studies were reexamined after treatment for 2 to 3 years.	7985599	-1
